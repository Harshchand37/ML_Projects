# Project1
 Heart Stroke Prediction, this needs a classiefier as this is a classification problem , i have used Logistic Regression Classifier (lrc),Support Vector Machine Classifier (svc),Decision Tree Classifier (dtc),Random Forest Classifier (rfc):
 Before all this intensive EDA was done.
# Short info About the classifiers 
Logistic Regression Classifier (lrc):

Logistic regression is a linear classification algorithm used for binary and multi-class classification problems.
It models the relationship between the features and the probability of a specific outcome using the logistic function.
It's simple, interpretable, and works well when the data is linearly separable.
Support Vector Machine Classifier (svc):

Support Vector Machine is a powerful classification algorithm that can handle both linear and non-linear data.
It finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space.
It is effective for handling complex decision boundaries and can work well with limited data.
Decision Tree Classifier (dtc):

A decision tree is a tree-like model where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents a class label.
It recursively splits the data into subsets by selecting the most informative feature at each step.
Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both numerical and categorical data.
Random Forest Classifier (rfc):

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting.
It creates a set of decision trees and aggregates their predictions to make the final classification.
Random forests are robust, handle high-dimensional data well, and are less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
